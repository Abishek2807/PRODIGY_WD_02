# PRODIGY_WD_02
# Stopwatch Application

## Overview
This project is a simple, browser-based stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch allows you to start, stop, resume, record laps, and reset the timer. The user interface is designed to be clean and intuitive, displaying the elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Features
- **Start/Stop/Resume:** Start the stopwatch, stop it at any time, and resume where you left off.
- **Lap:** Record and display lap times while the stopwatch is running.
- **Reset:** Reset the stopwatch to `00:00:00.00` and clear all lap times.
- **Responsive Design:** The stopwatch is designed to be fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
